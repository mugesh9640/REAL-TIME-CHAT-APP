This project is a **full-stack real-time chat application** built as part of Task 2 for an internship assignment or coursework. The application provides a seamless and interactive messaging interface that allows users to exchange messages instantly over a WebSocket connection. The project is divided into two core parts:

- **Frontend (React-based Single Page Application)**
- **Backend (Node.js + Express + WebSocket)**

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of **real-time communication** using modern web development technologies and understand full-stack development practices by integrating frontend and backend components into one cohesive system.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

### ✅ Frontend:
- **React.js** – For building the dynamic and component-based user interface.
- **HTML5/CSS3** – To structure and style the UI elements.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – For app logic, handling socket events, and managing state.
- **WebSocket API** – For maintaining persistent communication with the backend.

### ✅ Backend:
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime used to build the backend server.
- **Express.js** – Web framework for building the API and socket server.
- **ws (WebSocket Library)** – Lightweight WebSocket implementation for Node.js.

### ✅ Platforms/Tools:
- **Visual Studio Code** – Primary code editor used for both frontend and backend.
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and repository hosting.
- **PowerShell / Command Line** – For terminal-based development and Git operations.
- **Browser (Chrome/Edge)** – For testing the user interface and functionality.

🚀 How It Works
The user opens the frontend app in the browser.

When the app loads, it establishes a WebSocket connection with the backend server.

Users can send messages through the input field, which are sent via WebSocket to the backend.

The backend server receives the message and broadcasts it to all connected clients.

All clients display the new message in real-time — without any page refresh.

🧠 Learning Outcomes
Understand and implement real-time web communication using WebSockets.

Practice component-based UI development using React.

Build a working Node.js WebSocket server with Express.

Learn to manage state, events, and rendering in React.

Perform Git version control and push code to a public GitHub repository.

💡 Future Enhancements
Add user authentication (e.g., login with username)

Store chat history in a database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)

Show active users in the chatroom

Support private messaging (DMs)

Improve UI with Tailwind CSS or Material UI
